# Crypto Data Web Scraper

## Description

This repository houses the code responsible for scraping cryptocurrency-related data from select online sources. It's geared towards extracting pertinent information such as crypto whale movements, airdrop details, sentiment analysis from news items, among others. The primary objective of this scraper is to furnish a dependable stream of data that can subsequently be processed by a backend server and then showcased through a frontend application.

## Features

- **Target Website Research:** The system preliminarily checks the `robots.txt` of each prospective website to ensure that the scraping activities are compliant.
- **Dynamic Data Extraction:** Leverages CSS selectors/XPath for flexible and precise data retrieval.
- **Error Handling:** Equipped with mechanisms to address failed requests and retry temporary hitches automatically.
- **Optimizations:** Introduces random delays between requests to emulate human browsing and thereby skirt detection. Additionally, it assesses concurrent requests to maximize scraping efficiency.
- **Temporary Storage:** Safeguards scraped data temporarily pending its transfer to the backend server.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Incorporates a logging framework to systematically track activities, errors, and successes.
